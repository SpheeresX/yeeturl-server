# yeeturl tools

**yeeturl tools** is a collection of Node.js scripts made to make managing instances easier for sysadmins. There are currently 2 scripts available:

- `erase-database.js`: removes everything from your database.
- `remove-id.js`: removes a URL (useful if a URL violates your ToS or the law).

To use them, simply type `node <script_name>` while being in the `tools` directory; these tools will ask you some questions before proceeding. Use at your own risk!
