   FAQ
=========

1. Why should I use yeeturl instead of something like Bitly?
yeeturl is a privacy-respecting service that encrypts your URLs, which means we can't read them.
If you don't care about privacy (you should), just use Bitly.

2. How much capacity do you currently have?
It is estimated that our service can host around 500,000 URLs.

3. What will happen when that limit will be exceeded?
We believe that the service will just stop accepting more links. We have a simple strategy to keep yeeturl from catching a fire:
- once we are going to get near our size limit, we're going to set an expiration time for future links
- if this won't help, we will clear our database (the users are going to get notified of this first).

4. What motivated you to run this service?
The need for a private URL shortening service. The majority of the services I tried were either broken, not private enough or sold your data.
Fun fact: it took just a single day to set up the basic working project, including E2EE. The rest was just working on fixing bugs, changing libraries and making the website look nice.

5. I don't think this service is safe when it comes to sustainability, is it?
It's going better than you might think. All services we use have some kind of 'free tier' which lets us run this app even if no one is going to donate to us, provided it isn't widely known.
